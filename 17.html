            <ul><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <li>How long should my resume be?<br>

                The standard of maintaining a one-page resume is outdated. If you have had an extensive career or many achievements, it's perfectly fine to go beyond the first page, but it's best to keep it under two pages. Ensure that the information is concise, relevant, and targeted, as hiring managers are often rushed.
                </li><br><br>
                <li>How far back should my work experience go?<br>

                    Only the last 10-15 years of work experience should be in your resume's "Professional Experience" section. If you have relevant experience that extends beyond that range, consider including an "Additional Related Experience" section or a "Highlighted Attributes" section.
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>How should I address employment gaps in my resume?<br>

                        It's best to address any employment gaps head-on in the "Professional Experience" section. Note that you only need to address any gaps within the 10-15 year employment window you're highlighting. You can include a "Career Break" for unplanned gaps or a "Planned Career Break" entry within your experience section.
                        </li><br><br>
                        <li>How should I choose which skills to include in my resume?<br>
                            
                            The skills to include will depend heavily on the position you're applying to. Carefully review the job description to identify key skills and attributes the employer is seeking. It's also worth mentioning that some of your best skills can be relevant but maybe aren't explicitly mentioned. Include a mixture of "soft" (or transferable) skills and "hard" (or technical) skills.
                            </li><br><br>
                            <li>How can I tailor my resume to the job I'm applying for?<br>

                                Tailoring your resume to the job is the best way to stand out and grab a recruiter's attention. Avoid sending a cookie-cutter resume. Include specific accomplishments you achieved, ideally with quantifiable metrics. If you're struggling to create momentum with your resume, consider leveraging AI for tips and prompts, hiring a career coach, or utilizing a resume builder to add an outside perspective and polish.</li><br><br>
        <li>Should I include a photo in my resume?<br>

            No, it's generally not recommended to include a photo in your resume. It can lead to unconscious bias and may distract the hiring manager from focusing on your qualifications.
            </li><br><br>
            <li>How should I format my resume?<br>

                Your resume should be easy to read and visually appealing. Use a simple, clean format with a font size between 10 and 12 points. Use bullet points to break up large blocks of text and ensure there's ample white space. Use a consistent font style and color scheme throughout.
                </li><br><br>
                <li>How should I list my education in my resume?<br>
                    
                    List your education in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent degree. Include the name of the institution, degree earned, and year of graduation. If you're still in school, you can list the expected graduation date.
